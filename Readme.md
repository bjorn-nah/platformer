# Platformer

Proof of concept of Snes platformer using SNDK


SNDK is a SDK for SNES with Higueul language https://github.com/Kannagi/SNDK
Grapichs assets by Pixel Frog: https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/pixel-adventure-1
Sound fx: https://jalastram.itch.io/8-bit-jump-sound-effects

Build the project:
I remove all the SNDK files on this repository (see .gitignore) so to build you sould add missing files from the SNDK Release.
Extract all files from the SNDK archive to the project directory should do the trick, then run the higleul executable.
